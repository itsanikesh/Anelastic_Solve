\subsection{Pressure test program}
Running the Pressure solver test program is done with the combination of
ptest.x and ptest.ini. This program can be used to find an optimal domain
decomposition and to tune multigrid settings for the problem to be be studied.
All settings for the simulations are given in ptest.ini. An example file is
given below:
\input{autogen/ptestini}

The ptest.ini file is essentially a smaller version of Sturb.ini. The one major
difference in the two files is the TestCase block in ptest.ini.
