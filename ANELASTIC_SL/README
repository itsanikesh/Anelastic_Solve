Getting Started:
Documentation is located in the doc directory. To generate documentation 
1. cd doc/
2. make
3. ./createdoc

To compile the code
1. Copy the relevant file in arch/ to arch.in 
2. There are a number of options when typing make
	make : makes the sturb.x dns program
	make ptest : makes the pressure solver test program
	make interp1 : makes the interpolation program in X1
	make interp2 : makes the interpolation program in X2
	make interp3 : makes the interpolation program in X3
	make grid : makes the grid program, must turn off -DPARALLEL,
                    and make sure readINI.o does not exist for the parallel
                    version, this is a tricky item.
	make mglib : makes the library for the pressure solver

  make clean : cleans the current directory of .x, .o, .oo, lib*.a and .mod files.
  make cleanall : cleans all sub-directories of .x, .o, .oo, lib*.a and .mod files.
