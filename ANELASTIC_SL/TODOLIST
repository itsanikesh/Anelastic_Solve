Must Dos
1 Add Algorithms for DNS solver, Multigrid Pressure Solver, Grid Generation
  Program, Interpolation program to doc/manual.tex.
2 Document files in post/ directory, add a statistics section to manual.tex.

Should Dos
1 Combine Interpolation program into 1 program rather than 3 sub-programs
2 Remove utils/BC.F90 and utils/Ghost.F90 after DNS solver is working
3 Create Wake and Shear Layer directories in runfiles/
4 Organize files in post/
6 Figure out how to make grid program without having to turn off the parallel
  flag manually, this will have to also make a serial version of readINI.F90
  and then delete it when it is done... this is a tricky area.
5 Set up sf2s@gmail.com account
6 Post sf2s online, work on legal statements if necessary...
7 Implement threading using OpenMP for the serial version

Dreams
1 Implement threading using OpenMP to make a hybrid MPI/OpenMP code
