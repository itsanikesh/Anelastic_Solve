While debugging your DLL, it may be easier for you
to run Tecplot directly from you Visual C++ DLL project.
To do this:

1. Select Project/Settings.
2. Click the Debug tab.
3. Set "Executable for debug sessions" file to "tecplot.exe" (include the full path if necessary).
4. Set "Working Directory" to "Debug".
5. Set "Program Arguments" to "-loadaddon $$ROOT$$"

$$IF(AW_FORTRANLANGUAGE)
Note: You can avoid compiler warnings about not finding 'GUI.INC', and 'FGLUE.INC' by
adding the TecplotHome/Include directory to the global list of directories.

For example, if Tecplot is installed in c:\tec90, then from Developer Studio, select
"Tools/Options..." and click on the "Directories" tab. Add "c:\tec90\Include" to list
of include directories to search.
$$ENDIF
