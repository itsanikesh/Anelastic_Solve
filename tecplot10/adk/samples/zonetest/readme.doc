Description:  This addon demonstrates ways to manipulate a zone
              in tecplot.  For simplicity sake this addon only 
              operates on zone 1.  You can shrink the size of
              a zone, expand the size of a zone, or probe to add
              more cells to a finite element zone.

How to use    First, load data or create data from scratch and set
this addon:   the frame mode to be 2D.  Bring up the zone test addon
              by selecting "Zone Test" from the "Tools" menu.

              Press "Shrink Zone" to shrink the zone.
              Press "Expand Zone" to expand the zone.

              Pressing "Refine Cells" installs a probe override function
              and sets the tecplot mouse mode to probe.  Each time you
              probe, the cell that is probed in will be sub-divided into
              multiple fe cells with a new point added where you probed.
              Zone 1 must be a finite element triangular or quadrilateral
              zone.


Additional
Features:     This addon also demonstrates how to augment tecplot's macro
              language with new commands that replicate the actions of this
              addon.
