This addon demonstrates how to write a data converter using
fortran.  This converter is extremely simple.  The 
converter will load files that look like:

NumVars
NumDataPoints
nnn nnn nnn nnn
nnn nnn nnn nnn
nnn nnn nnn nnn
nnn nnn nnn nnn
nnn nnn nnn nnn
nnn nnn nnn nnn

For an example of a data loader that can read this
data see fexload
