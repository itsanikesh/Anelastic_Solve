This addon demonstrates the ability to make a "usefull"
general purpose addon that manipulates data using FORTRAN.
This addon also extends tecplot's macro language.

This addon does NOT operate on or create data using the
new (version 10) cell centered value location.

This addon provides the ability to create an IJK-Ordered
based on the cell centers of a source IJK-Ordered zone.

If run via a macro you can use:

$!ADDONCOMMAND
  ADDONID = "Create Cell Center"
  COMMAND = 'nnn'

where nnn is the number of the source zone to use.




   Building the addon:


      1.  Make sure you have your environment set up
          as per instructions in section 2.1 of the ADK 
          Users Manual (adk/doc/90adkum.pdf).


      2.  Put the files in this distribution in a directory
          called "cellctr" below the directory you created
          in step 2. in the instructions from section 2.1
          of the ADK users manual.

      3.  from the cellctr directory type:

             Runmake sgix.65 -d


      4.  You now have a "debug" version of the addon.  You
          can cut and paste the instructions left for you after
          the build to run the addon OR follow step 2 in
          section 2.2 of the ADK users manual using "cellctr"
          in place of "MyAddOnName".  Tecplot will then
          use the addon when you type:


          tecplot -develop
          



Using the addon.


    1.  From the interface.

          - Load in IJK-Ordered data.
          - Launch the addon dialog via the tools menu.
          - Select a source zone.
          - Click Ok.


    2.  From a macro.

        $!ADDONCOMMAND 
          ADDONID='Create Cell Center' 
          COMMAND='1'

        The above will use zone 1 as the source for creating
        a cell centered zone.
