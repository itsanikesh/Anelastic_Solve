General
-------
The Create SubFEZone utility is an example add-on for demonstrating some
of the TecUtil ADK functionality to the add-on writer. Additionally, however,
it provides the general user with the capability to create a sub-finite element
zone from one or more existing FE zones.

Access to the Create SubFEZone is achieved by selecting it from Tecplot's
"Tools" menu. If the option can not be found under the "Tools"
menu then Tecplot was not instructed to load the add-on. Edit the
"tecplot.add" file, insert the following line, and restart Tecplot
(see the ADK Reference manual for details):

  $!LoadAddOn "crsfez"

A single push button labeled "Create" directs the utility to create a
finite element zone from one or more finite element zones within the
current data view. If no finite element zones are within the current
data view then the button is desensitized. The current data view can
be changed by using Tecplot's data zoom tool or any of the standard
facilities within Tecplot used for adjusting the data view.

A cell is included in the sub-finite element zone if it is
entirely within the data view boundary. If any vertex of the cell
lies outside the data view boundary the cell is excluded from the
list of cells used to create the zone.

The choice of names, Create Sub-FEZone, was perhaps not optimal because
the utility can just as easily be used for combining two or more finite
element zones into one superset by ensuring that the data view encompasses
both sets of data.
