This addon brings up a dialog box with 2 scales and a button labeled 
"reset".  Press reset to start.  One scale adjusts the phase
of the sine wave and the other the amplitude.


   The code:
   ---------
   
      sinewave.F:  
         This contains the standard "InitTecAddOn()" function with
         calls to register the addon with tecplot and install the menu
         option.  A function called InitializeSineWave is called to
         initialize a few global variables.  


      guicb.F:     
         This is the standard module that contains the callback functions
         for the dialog used by the sinewave addon.  The sinewave
         dialog is modal and, being lazy I make the "Ok" and "Cancel" 
         buttons do the same thing - namely close the dialog.

         PhaseScale_SC_D1_CB and PhaseScale_SCD_D1_CB are the callbacks
         associated with the phase scale.  the "_SC_" form is only called
         when the user releases the scale after dragging it.  The "_SCD_"
         form is called at every drag event.  For this situation the 
         "_SC_" function is left empty and only the "_SCD_" function
         is being used.

         When a drag event occurs on the "Phase" scale, PhaseScale_SCD_D1_CB
         is called which updates the phase of the sine wave and calls
         drawwave() which draws a new sine wave.
                   
         Similar with the AmpScale_SC_D1_CB and AmpScale_SCD_D1_CB functions.


         Subroutine Reset_BTN_D1_CB is called when the reset button is pushed.
         This function turns around and calls ResetDataSet() which is in
         util.F and is discussed below.


      util.F       
         This is where all the real work is done.

         ResetDataSet is called when the by Reset_BTN_D1_CB after the reset
         button is pressed.  This function does the following:

            - Locks tecplot
            - clears out all frames in tecplot (i.e. does a $!NEWLAYOUT)
            - Creates a dataset out of thin air and stuffs it into tecplot.
            - Sets up an XY plot with a reasonable style.
            - Draws the first sinewave


         drawwave() does the following:

            - Makes sure it is ok to draw.
            - Gains access to the X and Y arrays inside of tecplot
            - Calls calcxy() to update the X and Y arrays to new values.
            - redraws the plot.  (NOTE: sinewave2 is more efficient on how the
              plot is redrawn)



         calcxy() simply calculates the x,y coordinates for a new sinewave given
         the current amplitude and phase.
