This addon demonstrates how to write a data loader using
fortran.  This dataloader is extremely simple.  The 
loader will load files that look like:

NumVars
NumDataPoints
nnn nnn nnn nnn
nnn nnn nnn nnn
nnn nnn nnn nnn
nnn nnn nnn nnn
nnn nnn nnn nnn
nnn nnn nnn nnn
.
.
.
.

The instructions this loader takes are:

-FILENAME "filename"
[-SKIP n]


For example, the following instructions are valid:


'-FILENAME "myfile.dat" -SKIP 2'

'-FILENAME "myfile.dat"'
