This sample add-on demonstrates how to create a very simple sidebar using
FORTRAN that replaces Tecplot's default sidebar. The new sidebar should contain
an array of buttons that perform specified tasks. In the case of this add-on it
implements six of the 16 buttons: Data, Alter, Contour, Scatter, Zoom In, and
Zoom Out. The remaining 10 button are left unimplemented.

The add-on was create using the following steps:
  1) The CreateNewAddOn script was run to make a general purpose skeleton
     add-on to replace Tecplot's default sidebar. The script ask questions
     to determine what kind of add-on skeleton is desired.
  2) Using the Tecplot GUI Builder add-on the skeleton gui.lay file created by
     the CreateNewAddOn script in step #1 was modified to include two columns
     of task buttons separated by a vertical line. The zoom buttons were just
     placed below the two columns.
  3) The Tecplot GUI Builder add-on was then directed to build the add-on
     interface files. The guicb.tmp file produced by the Tecplot GUI builder
     based on the newly added interface controls was then copied to guicb.F
     to replace the one originally created by the CreateNewAddOn script in
     step #1.
  4) Following the instructions in the ADK User Manual for building add-ons the
     Runmake script was used to compile and link the add-on for the desired
     platform.
  5) Finally the addon can be loaded into Tecplot by adding it to the tecplot.add
     file or launching it from the command line per the instructions in the ADK
     User Manual. Once loaded you can activate the sidebar from the Tools menu
     or via the Workspace->Sidebar sub-menu.

Note: In step #2 the guicb.tmp file simply replaced the guicb.F file. If you
had already edit guicb.F and added code that was not originally created by the
CreateNewAddOn script or the GUI builder you would have to copy any new
functions in guicb.tmp to guicb.F by hand so that you preserve your original
code.
