############################## OPENGL OPTIMIZATION ############################
#
# Amtec has configured Tecplot's OpenGL for numerous graphics card
# configurations with the latest drivers installed. Notwithstanding
# new or outdated graphics cards, or other machine/card combinations
# that Amtec has not tested may need specific attention. Below are
# a few of the common settings that can be adjusted to remedy most
# graphics card rendering problems. Whenever possible first try
# installing the latest drivers for your graphics card.
#
# $!INTERFACE
#   OPENGLCONFIG
#     {
#       #
#       # For Windows machines only an option is available to turn off
#       # hardware acceleration for Tecplot without having to adjust your
#       # Windows display properties. Turning off hardware acceleration
#       # may force Tecplot to use a set of OpenGL drivers that are not
#       # tuned for the graphics card. This setting will hamper display
#       # performance however it may correct buggy graphics card drivers.
#       #
#       ALLOWHWACCELERATION = NO
#
#       #
#       # Tecplot has a number of other OpenGL configurations that solve
#       # specific graphics card related problems for both on-screen and
#       # off-screen rendering.
#       #
#       # If you notice the last pixel of stroked font characters not
#       # rendering use the following setting for DOEXTRADRAWFORLASTPIXEL.
#       # If thin patterned lines are not rendering correctly use the
#       # setting below for STIPPLEALLLINES. For low memory graphics
#       # cards you may need to reduce the depth buffer size by reducing
#       # the DEPTHBUFFERSIZE. Finally, some graphics cards have trouble
#       # with long triangle and quad strips. If you are having problems
#       # with strips (the default Tecplot configuation) try reducing the
#       # strip length as directed below.
#       #
#       # If some shaded or contour flooded quads or triangles do not
#       # appear or are black turn off quad strips, turn on triangulation
#       # of filled polygons, and leave triangle strips on. This forces
#       # Tecplot to convert all quad strip candidates to triangle strips,
#       # single quads to be triangulated, and has only a minor impact on
#       # display performance. If the problem still exists turn off triangle
#       # strips as well. Please note that this combination of settings will
#       # hamper display performance since strips will no longer be used
#       # however it may correct buggy graphics card drivers.
#       #
#       # Other graphics card problems such as random crashing can be solved
#       # by lowering the maximum strip length, MAXSTRIPLENGTH. Tecplot
#       # attempts to maximize strip lengths given to the graphics card.
#       # Try maximum sizes of 10 or 20.
#       #
#       # Some graphics cards have problems with an OpenGL's glColorMaterial
#       # function. Higher performance (especially for continuous contour
#       # flooded plots) can be achieved when it is used however it,
#       # USEGLCOLORMATERIALFUNCTION, may need to be turned off if you are
#       # experiencing problems.
