<h1>Sidebar Performance</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Display Performance dialog addresses four different areas:</p>

<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><font size=2 style="font-size:10pt;">On Screen performance.</font></span></p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2">Graphics cache settings.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2">Status line options.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2">Other miscellaneous style 
 options.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first two deal with changing Tecplot's performance by changing the 
 level of detail of what is drawn or how often something is drawn. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second two merely allow you change what is seen in the work area 
 or change the style for selected plot types to gain better performance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">On Screen Performance</p>

<p>Here you can configure the responsiveness of Tecplot and the level of 
 detail.</p>

<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><font size=2 style="font-size:10pt;">Use Auto Redraw: 
 Choose whether Tecplot automatically redraws the plot when the plot is 
 changed. A drawing can always be interrupted by the user by clicking with 
 the mouse in the work area.</font></span></p></li>
</ul>

<p class="whs4">Note: There are a number 
 of phases Tecplot goes through when processing a drawing in the work area. 
 Most of the phases can be interrupted by clicking with the mouse in the 
 work area. However, there are some phases that cannot be interrupted.</p>

<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2">Approximate Plots for 
 Better Speed: Selecting this option instructs Tecplot to render plots 
 with a lesser degree of detail according to the Approximation Mode. The 
 Approximation Mode can be one of the following:</p></li>
	
	<ul type="circle" class="whs5">
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2">Automatic: In this 
 mode Tecplot will choose when the drawing in each frame is to be approximated 
 based on the Point Threshold for Automatic Approximation. If the number 
 of points used in a drawing in a frame exceed the Point Threshold then 
 Tecplot will create an approximated version of the plot and render that 
 first and then proceed to work on rendering a complete drawing. You will 
 see the approximated plot quickly and you can at that point elect to make 
 other changes to the plot. If you proceed in Tecplot before the final 
 drawing is completed Tecplot will interrupt the processing of the detailed 
 drawing. During rotation, translation, or smooth zoom, the plot will remain 
 approximated until the mouse button is released.</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2">Non-Current Frames 
 Always Approximated: Choosing this option is like Automatic except that 
 all non-current frames are always approximated. After a change in the 
 current frame you will see all frames with an approximate drawing followed 
 by the current frame drawn in full detail. The non-current frames are 
 left as is. You can see a full detail drawing in all frames by clicking 
 Redraw All on the sidebar or clicking with the middle mouse in the work 
 area (outside of any frame).</p></li>
		
		<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2">All Frames Always 
 Approximated: In this mode the drawing in all frames is always approximated 
 while you change views or style. You can see a full detail plot of the 
 currently active frame by clicking Redraw on the sidebar or by clicking 
 the middle mouse in the current frame. You can see a full detail plot 
 of all frames by clicking Redraw All on the sidebar by clicking with the 
 middle mouse in the work area (outside of any frame).</p></li>
	</ul>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><font size=2 style="font-size:10pt;">Point Threshold 
 for Automatic Approximation: The drawing in a frame is a candidate to 
 be approximated if the number of points used to draw the full plot exceeds 
 this value. This is only a factor if the Approximation Mode is Automatic 
 or Non-Current Frames Always Approximated.</font></span></p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2">Approximate Plot as % 
 of Full Plot: When a plot is approximated it will be drawn with this percentage 
 of the original data. In some cases Tecplot will plot more than this percentage 
 to preserve the shape of the data.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2">Show Text/Geometries 
 in Approximate Plots: Text and geometries are not approximated because 
 it is assumed that they do not affect performance. If you are plotting 
 a large number of text or geometries then you can unselect this option 
 to remove text and geometries from the approximated views.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">Graphics Cache</p>

<p>The Graphics Cache is used to store instructions for OpenGL display 
 lists used to draw in the work area. If a significant amount of processing 
 is needed to create the instructions, then saving the instructions for 
 repeated use can increase the rendering speed significantly. The graphics 
 cache can greatly speed up drawing for a number of situations including 
 3-D view changes, changing the style in a sub-set of the plot (that is, 
 changing the style of iso-surfaces only), or for repairing of the Tecplot 
 work area after it has been damaged because a dialog has moved on top.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If graphics are not cached you may experience situations where most 
 or all of your plot is not drawn on the screen. This can occur when the 
 work area is damaged by moving another dialog on top of it for example. 
 If you have Auto Redraw turned off, the work area will have frames that 
 are not drawn at all and remain that way until you click Redraw All.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">Status Line</p>

<p>Three check boxes used to configure the status line are located at the 
 top of the dialog. You may enable or disable the display of running coordinates 
 and status line messages, or turn off the status line altogether.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs3">Image Export Options</p>

<p>Two choices are available for the rendering location when exporting 
 images. You can choose to have the images rendered on- or off-screen.</p>

<ul type="disc" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2">Safe (Render Image Off-Screen): 
 Rendering off-screen allows you to render to any image size and you do 
 not have to be concerned with dialogs and so forth, obscuring any portion 
 of the image.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2">Fast (Render Image On-Screen): 
 Rendering on-screen is faster (especially on UNIX), but you must take 
 care to move all dialogs and other applications away from the image area 
 and you are limited to exporting an image sized the same as it appears 
 on the screen.</p></li>
</ul>
