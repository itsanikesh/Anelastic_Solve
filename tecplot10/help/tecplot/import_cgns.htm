<h1>Import CGNS</h1>

<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>CGNS Data Loader,</B></span> including 
 the <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Load CGNS Options:</B></span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Zones</I></span>, 
 <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Load CGNS Options:</B></span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Index 
 Ranges</I></span>, and <span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Load CGNS Options</B></span>: 
 <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Index Ranges</I></span> dialogs</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CGNS Data Loader allows you to read CGNS files created with CGNSLib 
 Version 2.3 &nbsp;or 
 earlier into Tecplot. You are able to choose either all or specific bases, 
 zones, and solutions to be loaded into Tecplot zones. You can also select 
 field variables individually. For structured-grid zones you are allowed 
 to define index ranges to load specific subzone blocks or planes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only CGNS bases and zones with valid grids can be read by the CGNS data 
 loader. For unstructured grids Version 2.1 of the CGNS loader supports 
 <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-weight: bold;"><B>BAR_2, 
 TRI_3, QUAD_4, TETRA_4, PYRA_5, PENTA_6, HEXA_8, MIXED</B></span> element 
 types and their combinations on every section. However, the CGNS Data 
 Loader does not support higher-order element types.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only vertex and cell-center field variable locations are supported. 
 Cell-centered data is averaged to the nodes when the file is read. For 
 structured grids arithmetic averaging is used. Rind data is used in the 
 averaging if it is available. For unstructured grids either a Laplacian 
 averaging or arithmetic averaging can be selected to average the cell 
 data to the surrounding nodes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following options are available:</p>

<ul type="circle" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2"><span style="font-style: italic;"><I>File:</I></span> 
 Enter the name of the CGNS file you wish to load including the complete 
 path, or click &quot;...&quot; to browse the file system to locate the 
 file.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2"><span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Specify 
 Options:</I></span> This check box is enabled only when a valid CGNS file 
 has been entered/selected. If not selected, CGNS Data Loader will load 
 every base, zone, solution, and variable into Tecplot when you click OK. 
 By selecting this option you are allowed to specifically control the data 
 that will be loaded from your CGNS file. This gives you the ability to 
 only load particular zones or field variables or even to load partial 
 zones.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2"><span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Select 
 Zones</I></span> calls up the Load CGNS Options: Zones dialog, which allows 
 you to select specific zones and partial zones to load.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2"><span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Select 
 Variables</I></span> calls up the Load CGNS Options: Variables dialog, which 
 allows you to select specific field variables to load. The grid variables 
 are always loaded automatically. In the absence of field variables, Select 
 Variables is not active.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul type="circle" class="whs1">
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2"><span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Averaging:</I></span> 
 When the field variables are stored at cell centers, either a Laplacian 
 averaging or arithmetic averaging may be used to average the cell data 
 to the nodes they surround. This can result in a bias at the boundary 
 nodes. Arithmetic averaging is automatically used for ordered/structured 
 zones. When available, Rind data is used in the averaging.</p></li>
	
	<li class=kadov-p><p class="whs2"><span style="font-style: italic;"><I>CGNS 
 Section Mapping:</I></span> CGNS files sometimes have multiple node-maps for 
 each finite-element zone. These are called sections, and a zone may contain 
 sections with different cell-types and cell dimensions. For example, one 
 section may be <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-weight: bold;"><B>TETRA_4</B></span> 
 (tetrahedral element - 3D cell dimension) for the volume zone and another 
 section may be <span style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace; font-weight: bold;"><B>TRI_3</B></span> 
 (triangular element - 2D cell dimension) for various surfaces surrounding 
 the volume zone. If you select <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>One Tecplot 
 zone per CGNS zone/solution</I></span> (default), it will combine all sections 
 with the zone cell-dimension into one Tecplot zone. If you select <span 
 style="font-style: italic;"><I>Load each section as separate Tecplot zone, 
 </I></span>it will create a separate Tecplot zone for each section regardless 
 of cell dimension.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Load CGNS Options:</B></span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Zones</I></span></p>

<p>This dialog is used to specify the zones to load from the data file. 
 The zones that were found in the CGNS data file are listed under Zones 
 from CGNS. Tecplot zones are not always equivalent to CGNS zones. For 
 example, each solution for a CGNS zone is considered a unique Tecplot 
 zone. The CGNS base, zone, and solution hierarchy orders the zones in 
 this list. The integer that precedes the word “Zone” is the Tecplot zone 
 number that has been assigned to that zone. The integer after the word 
 “Zone” represents the order in which the zone was found in the CGNS data 
 file. The zone description includes the CGNS hierarchy information in 
 parentheses, where “CGNS B, Z, S =” followed by three integers represents 
 the CGNS order for the base, zone, and solution, respectively. If a single 
 base is found, then just “CGNS Z, S =” and two integers are displayed. 
 The description also indicates whether the zone is Ordered (structured) 
 or FE (finite-element or unstructured). The I-, J-, and K-dimensions are 
 provided for ordered zones, and the number of nodes and elements are provided 
 for finite-element zones.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By default all zones are selected for reading and are listed under Zones 
 to Load. This list may be deleted by clicking Remove All. You can also 
 selectively remove zones from the Zones to Load list by highlighting the 
 zone(s) with a click, click-and-drag, Ctrl-click, or Shift-click and then 
 clicking Remove. This will not affect the order of the zones in the Zones 
 from CGNS list, however, the zones that do not appear in the Zones to 
 Load list will not have a Tecplot zone number assigned to them. Similarly, 
 all zones can be added to Zones to Load by clicking Move All, or they 
 can be added selectively by highlighting the zone(s) to be added in the 
 Zones from CGNS list, then clicking Move.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Note:</B></span> Zones in the Zones to 
 Load list will be listed in the order in which they were added to the 
 list regardless of their order in the Zones from CGNS list. This order 
 is the basis for their Tecplot zone number, which is how they will be 
 identified in Tecplot. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Load CGNS Options:</B></span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Index 
 Ranges</I></span></p>

<p>To load a partial zone or subzone first highlight the zone(s) of interest 
 in the Zones to Load list, then click Index Ranges for Zone(s). This will 
 bring up the Load CGNS Options: Index Ranges dialog.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This dialog is used to specify a subset of the selected ordered/structured 
 zone(s) to be loaded. It allows you to define a block, plane, or line 
 of points that will be extracted when the data is loaded. This is accomplished 
 by inputting the ranges for the I-, J-, and K-indices. For each index 
 you must enter Start, End, and Skip values. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Skip value is used to reduce the number of points that will be loaded 
 by skipping points. A Skip value of three loads every third point after 
 the Start point. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Start and End points are always loaded. If multiple zones have been 
 selected prior to entering this dialog, the default values for End will 
 be Mx, indicating the maximum value for each zone. You may enter any value 
 for End, but it will only be used in the zones for which it is meaningful. 
 If the value is greater than the maximum index for a zone, then the End 
 for that zone will be replaced by that maximum index. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For multi-dimensional zones the number of points that can be specified 
 to load for the I- and J-directions must be greater than one. If the inputs 
 for Start, End, and Skip result in a single point in either direction, 
 an error message will be displayed and you will be forced to change your 
 inputs or cancel the dialog.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Load CGNS Options:</B></span> <span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Variables</I></span></p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;"><I>The Load CGNS Options:</I></span> Variables 
 dialog contains two lists: Variables from CGNS and Variables to Load. 
 The Variables from CGNS list includes all field variables that were found 
 in the CGNS data file regardless of the zone(s) to which they belong, 
 since CGNS files may contain zones that have different field variables. 
 The Variables to Load list contains the field variables that have been 
 selected to load into Tecplot. Initially, both lists are the same. A Tecplot 
 variable number is assigned to each CGNS field variable that appears in 
 the Variables to Load list. Since Tecplot requires every zone to have 
 the same number of variables, each zone that is loaded into Tecplot will 
 include every variable in the Variables to Load list. This will occur 
 regardless of whether the zone included that field variable in the CGNS 
 file. The variables that were not originally in the zone will be initialized 
 to zero before they are loaded into Tecplot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><B>Note:</B></span> Since this can unnecessarily 
 increase the size of the data set in Tecplot, carefully examine the Variables 
 from CGNS list to guarantee that the field variables selected for the 
 Variables to Load list will be consistent with the zones to be loaded.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Remove All</I></span> lets you delete 
 all variables from the Variables to Load list.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Move All</I></span> lets you include all 
 variables from the Variables from CGNS list. You can also selectively 
 remove variables from the Variables to Load list by highlighting the variable(s) 
 with a click, click-and-drag, Ctrl-click, or Shift-click and then clicking 
 Remove. The field variables that do not appear in the Variables to Load 
 list will not have a Tecplot variable number assigned to them. Similarly, 
 variables can be added to the Variables to Load by selectively highlighting 
 the variable(s) to be added in the Variables from CGNS list and then clicking 
 Move.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic;"><I>Note:</I></span> Variables in the Variables 
 to Load list will be listed in the order in which they were added to the 
 list regardless of their order in the Variables from CGNS list. This order 
 is the basis for their Tecplot variable number, which is how they will 
 be ordered in Tecplot. </p>
