<h1>Import HDF 5</h1>

<p>Selecting the HDF5loader add-on from the Tecplot File/Import dialog 
 allows you to import general HDF5 files into Tecplot. The loader provides 
 a mechanism for importing generic data from multiple HDF5 datasets or 
 groups. The H5loader will load datasets within user selected groups, load 
 one or more user selected datasets to one zone, load multiple user selected 
 datasets to multiple zones, execute macros after data has been loaded, 
 create implicit X, Y, and Z grid vectors as needed, sub-sample loaded 
 data, and reference user selected vectors for X, Y, and Z grids. Datasets 
 must be formatted as I, IJ, or IJK ordered data. For information regarding 
 HDF5 refer to http://hdf.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF5/.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Data Selection</p>

<p>HDF5 files may be viewed and selected by pressing the Select File button 
 in the H5loader dialog. One or more files may be selected if all selected 
 files have an identical hierarchy. Hierarchy information for the selected 
 HDF5 files is displayed in the Available Datasets window in the form: 
 /group/[group]…/dataset - the dimension of each dataset is displayed immediately 
 following the dataset name. In this window one or more datasets or groups 
 may be selected for loading.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Importing/Loading Data</p>

<p>Datasets may be loaded using one of three methods: 1) loading multiple 
 datasets to one zone, 2) loading multiple datasets to separate zones, 
 or 3) loading datasets by group.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Loading Multiple Datasets to One Zone</p>

<p>Loading multiple datasets to one zone is the default method of importing 
 HDF5 files. Using this method the HDF5loader will create one zone with 
 N variables where N is the number of HDF5 datasets selected in the Available 
 Datasets window. Selected datasets may have 1 to 3 dimensions. The dimension 
 of loaded Tecplot variables will match the I, J, and K values of the selected 
 datasets. Variable names are assigned the corresponding names of selected 
 datasets - the dimensionality of each selected dataset must be equivalent. 
 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To import your data, select one or more datasets from the Available 
 Datasets window. All selected datasets must be identical in dimension; 
 dataset dimensions are shown immediately to the right of dataset names 
 in the Available Datasets window. Once you have selected the datasets 
 to load press the OK button.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Loading Multiple Datasets to Separate Zones</p>

<p>Using this method the HDF5loader will create N zones where N is the 
 number of datasets selected in the Available Datasets window. Each zone 
 contains one variable per selected dataset where each dataset must have 
 1 to 3 dimensions. The I, J, and K values of each Tecplot zone will match 
 the dimensionality of each selected dataset. Variable and zone names are 
 automatically assigned. Dimensionality may vary between selected datasets. 
 </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To import your data using this method, select the Load to Separate Zones 
 toggle. Select one or more datasets from the Available Datasets window. 
 Once you have selected the datasets you want to load, press the OK button. 
 One zone will be created for each selected dataset and each zone will 
 contain exactly one variable (unless you selected Create Implicit Grid 
 Values or Reference Data Grids.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Loading Datasets by Group</p>

<p>Using this method the HDF5loader will create N zones with M variables 
 where N is the number of groups selected in the Available Datasets window 
 and M is the number of datasets in each group. The I, J, and K indices 
 of the Tecplot variables will be equivalent to the respective dimension 
 of selected datasets. Datasets in any selected group must be equal in 
 dimension; however datasets may be unequal in dimension between groups. 
 When selecting multiple groups all groups must contain an equal number 
 of datasets and dataset names must be identical between groups. The HDF5 
 loader will only load datasets within the root directory or within a subgroup, 
 i.e., the HDF5loader will not load data within nested groups.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To import your data using this method, select the Load Datasets by Group 
 toggle. Press Select File to open a HDF5 file. Select one or more groups 
 from the Available Datasets window; all groups must contain an equal number 
 of datasets where all datasets have identical names between groups. Press 
 the OK button to load your data. The number of selected groups determines 
 the number of zones that load into Tecplot. Zone names will match the 
 name of the corresponding group. Variable names will match the respective 
 dataset name. Each zone will include as many variables as datasets per 
 selected groups. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Additional Options</p>

<p>Additional options may be specified when loading HDF5 data into Tecplot 
 using methods described in sections 1.2.1, 1.2.2, and 1.2.3. These options 
 allow you to execute macros after data has been loaded, sub-sample loaded 
 data, reference user selected vectors for X, Y, and Z grid values, and 
 automatically create X, Y, and Z grid vectors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Using Macros</p>

<p>Macros may be defined within a HDF5 vector and placed in any group. 
 Each character string in the selected vector must be a valid one-line 
 Tecplot macro. Macros are executed in the order encountered and after 
 all data are loaded.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To run a macro defined as a character vector in your HDF5 file, select 
 the Run Macros in Selected Group toggle. From the Select Macro pull-down 
 menu select the macro you want to execute. Proceed by following one of 
 the methods described in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 for loading HDF5 data. 
 Your macro will run after your data has been successfully loaded into 
 Tecplot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Sub-Sampling Data</p>

<p>The H5loader will sub-sample the first, second, and third dimensions 
 of loaded datasets respectively as defined by the user. The default skip-value 
 is 1. When specifying non-unitary skip values the dimensionality of all 
 selected datasets must be equivalent. Datasets will be sub-sampled using 
 the user defined I-Skip, J-Skip, and/or K-Skip values – skip values must 
 be whole numbers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To sub-sample data in the first, and/or second, and/or third dimensions 
 of selected datasets change the respective I-Skip, and/or J-Skip, and/or 
 K-Skip values located in the HDF5Loader dialog. If the skip-values are 
 non-unitary then the dimensionality of all selected datasets must be equivalent. 
 Proceed by following one of the methods described in sections 3.1, 3.2, 
 and 3.3 for loading HDF5 data.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Referencing Data Grids</p>

<p>The HDF5Loader allows users to specify X, and/or Y, and/or Z grid vectors. 
 Selected vectors are used for plotting all zones. Vectors are of dimension 
 1 and length M. The X grid vector length must equal to the first dimension 
 of selected datasets, the Y grid vector length must be equal to the second 
 dimension of selected datasets, and the Z grid vector length must be equal 
 to the third dimension of selected datasets. The number of selected grid 
 vectors must equal the rank of selected datasets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To define the grid vectors you may choose them from a pull-down menu. 
 Begin by unselecting the Create Implicit Grid Values option and select 
 the Reference Data Grids button. A child dialog will appear (Fig. 2), 
 from the X, Y, and Z menus select the vector you want to use as the corresponding 
 grid. You MUST select the toggle Use Data Grids. The number of grid vectors 
 you specify must equal the rank of selected datasets. Continue loading 
 your HDF5 data by following one of the methods described in sections 3.1, 
 3.2, and 3.3.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="whs1">Grid Generation</p>

<p>The H5loader can automatically create X, Y, and Z grid vectors as necessary 
 for selected datasets. Grid vectors will be of length equal to the corresponding 
 dimension.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To automatically create X, Y, and Z grid vectors select Create Implicit 
 Grid Values in the HDF5loader dialog – this is selected by default. Proceed 
 by following one of the methods described in sections 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3 
 to load your HDF5 data. The grid vectors will be created upon loading 
 your data into Tecplot.</p>
